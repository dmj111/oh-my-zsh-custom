This is my =custom= folder for using with [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]].

Short directions:

  1) Install oh-my-zsh
  2) delete the =custom= folder in oh-my-zsh, and check this folder
     out in its place.  
  3) Local files can be put in =local= here.  It is ignored by git.
  4) Run =config/setup.sh= (and hope its right!)
     
     This adds .zshrc and .zshenv to =$HOME=, which is useful for
     making stuff run correctly.  These files live in the =config=
     directory.  A local =.zshenv= can be added in the local folder,
     and it will be loaded by the main =.zshenv= file.
